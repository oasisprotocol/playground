  A simple showcase of a ollama-based chatbot running inside Oasis ROFL TDX.

  It consists of the following components:

  - `contracts` contains the Sapphire smart contract which confidentially stores
    the prompts and answers. It also makes sure that only an authorized TEE-based
    Oracle is allowed to read prompts and write answers back.
  - `oracle` a python-based oracle running inside a ROFL TEE that listens for a
    prompt on the Sapphire smart contract, relays it to the ollama service and
    writes the answer back to the smart contract.
  - `ollama` is a chat bot running inside a ROFL TEE that waits a prompt from
    `oracle`, generates a response using a preconfigured model and returns it.
  - `frontend` is a react-based frontend that makes sure the user is properly
    logged in via Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) protocol and makes sure the user's
    prompt is end-to-end encrypted when submitted to the Sapphire chain.
