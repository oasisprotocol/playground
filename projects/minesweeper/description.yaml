  The Minesweeper game on Oasis Sapphire ensures fair, tamper-proof gameplay by
  using secure RNG for random mine placement, solving issues of trust in
  traditional online games. On-chain betting adds transparency, allowing players
  to bet and win confidently.

  ### Key Features

  #### Secure Random Number Generation (RNG)

  - Oasis Sapphire’s RNG is used to randomly place mines in the grid. By using
  on-chain, secure RNG, the game ensures fairness and verifiability,
  guaranteeing that the placement of mines is truly random and not biased
  against players.

  - RNG uses the function Sapphire.randomBytes, generating a random seed for
  mine placement, so each game is unique and transparent.

  #### Gameplay and Betting Mechanics

  - **Betting:** Players can bet 1 TEST tokens to start a game. The game sets a
  minimum and maximum limit on bets to prevent unfair advantages or overly risky
  plays.

  - **Safe Moves and Winnings:** Players make moves to uncover grid positions.
  If a player selects a cell without a mine, they accumulate “safe moves,” which
  increases their winnings based on a multiplier. However, hitting a mine ends
  the game immediately.

  - **Cash Out Anytime:** Players can cash out their accumulated winnings at any
  time, allowing for flexible gameplay and strategic risk-taking.

  #### Smart Contract Logic

  - **Game Setup:** The game initializes by receiving a bet from the player,
  which starts a new session.

  - **Mine Placement:** Using Oasis Sapphire’s RNG, the contract randomly
  selects mine positions, ensuring a fair distribution on the 5x5 grid.

  - **Move Validation:** When a player makes a move, the contract checks if the
  selected position contains a mine. Safe moves increase the player’s winnings,
  while hitting a mine ends the game.

  - **Cash Out and Withdrawals:** Players can cash out their winnings at any
  point, and accumulated balances are stored securely on-chain. They can
  withdraw these funds directly to their wallets.
