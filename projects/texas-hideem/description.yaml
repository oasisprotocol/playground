  Howdy, Partner. "Texas Hide-Em" our brand-new, fully decentralized poker
  platform for onchain poker enthusiasts.
  
  By leveraging the Oasis Sapphire chain for confidentiality and randomness on
  the contract side, and hosting the dapp webpage directly on ethstorage, we
  present a poker dapp that has neither centralized frontend, nor a centralized
  backend, only a fully decentralized contract. (Whip Sound Effect)
  
  If you have been playing online poker regularly, you can remember the scandals
  with Absolute Poker or Ultimate Bet, where cheating superusers could view
  other player's cards. Our solution eradicates the superuser dilemma with
  confidential computing, keeping all cards provably secret until the showdown.
  (Good Bad and Ugly Theme Riff)
  
  This is not just poker; it's the future of online gaming, combining privacy,
  security, and fairness for all players.

  Welcome to "Texas Hide-Em," Hide-em high at the mile high city, Denver,
  Yeeeeeehaw.
