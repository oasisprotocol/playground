  Leverages the Oasis confidential blockchain and machine learning algorithms to
  serve targeted advertisements while prioritizing user privacy. Traditional
  advertising methods often compromise user data privacy, leading to concerns
  about data leaks and unauthorized access and selling of data. PrivAd addresses
  these concerns by ensuring that user data remains encrypted and anonymous
  throughout the ad-serving process. The advertisers in no moment have access
  to the user's private data, which is only used inside the confidential smart
  contract to serve personalized ads.
  
  PrivAds employs a combination of smart contracts, decentralized storage
  solutions, and machine learning models to analyze user behavior and
  preferences without giving advertisers access to user's sensitive personal
  information.

  Key features of PrivAds include:

  - Privacy-preserving targeted ads
  - Support for anti-fraud models
  - On-chain ML
  - Extremely low-dimensional word embeddings
  - User financial reward
  - Transparent ad-serving process
  - Advertiser cross-tracking protection
  - IPFS storage for ad-content
  - Opt-in participation
