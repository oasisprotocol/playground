  A Web3 platform built on a "Unified Invoice Pool System." Users upload
  their e-invoice carrier receipts to the blockchain and contribute them to
  designated "invoice pools" (each pool corresponds to a charity organization).
  After winning, smart contracts automatically distribute prize money according to
  each holder’s donation ratio (minimum 25%). Users set donation ratios when
  registering invoice carriers and receive NFT certificates (IVC) as verifiable
  proof. Privacy protection and verifiable credentials are foundational.
