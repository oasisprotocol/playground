  A compliance layer enabling developers to easily integrate compliance into
  smart contracts.

  Assura Network simplifies regulatory compliance for blockchain applications.
  Developers can integrate Assura in under an hour by importing contracts and
  adding a modifier—no need to build KYC systems or manage user databases.
  Assura's Oasis TEE evaluates users off-chain and provides cryptographically
  signed attestations verified on-chain.

  Core features include a 0-1000 confidence score based on wallet activity and
  KYC status, time-based bypass for users who prefer time-locks over KYC, and
  ENS subdomain integration for efficient tracking of compliant users.
