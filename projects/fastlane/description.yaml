  FastLane offers a unique and ever-evolving gameplay experience where users can
  test their skills, own and monetize in-game assets. Players navigate a
  dynamic, blockchain-powered road, overcoming unforeseen challenges set by
  other players. By owning checkpoints, users can earn income and shape the
  experience for others, fostering a collaborative and competitive environment.
  Whether you're a seasoned gamer, a blockchain enthusiast, or simply looking
  for something new, The Road provides an engaging platform to play, own, and
  contribute to a unique and ever-expanding world.

  FastLane is an on-chain game, here's how it makes tasks easier:
  
  1. Ownership and Control: Players own checkpoints on the road, represented as
     NFTs. They can control the difficulty and experience for those traversing
     their checkpoint by setting obstacles.
  
  2. Unpredictability and Engagement: Obstacles are encrypted and hidden until
     encountered, creating a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience. New
     checkpoints continuously increase the road's length and potential for
     variation.
  
  3. Monetization Opportunities: Players can earn income through fees paid by
     others attempting their checkpoints and potentially through strategic
     placement of advertisements along the road.
