  Grand Warden is a privacy-first password manager that combines decentralized
  storage (Walrus), client-side encryption (Seal), and confidential computing.
  Credentials stay off centralized servers, and breach checks run inside Oasis
  ROFL TEEs so passwords are never exposed.

  The app adds AI-assisted risk analysis and on-chain attestations to help users
  understand and improve their security posture. It aims to make credential
  management proactive, verifiable, and user-controlled.
