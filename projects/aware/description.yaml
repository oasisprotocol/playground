  A whisper heard, A world transformed decentralized civil help
  platform designed to empower citizens with anonymous incident reporting and
  spread awarness.

  Inspired by the Bat Signal from Batman, we’ve built something even better! A
  decentralized civil help platform designed to empower citizens with anonymous
  incident reporting and spread awarness.

  Citizens can report any issue causing harm at a societal and civil level
  anonymously, thanks to our robust privacy layer. Reports are verified by other
  citizens and AI agents, ensuring authenticity. Once verified, reports are made
  available for minting by news and media outlets, reducing their workload in
  fact-checking.

  Our AI agents analyze the severity of reports, prioritizing urgent cases for
  immediate action. Citizens are rewarded through a points system for reporting,
  while fake reports lead to point deductions. A minimum of 200 points is
  required to report or contribute to others' reports, ensuring quality and
  accountability. Plus, every citizen must verify their identity, ensuring one
  account per person.

  We’re creating a secure, transparent, and action-driven platform that puts the
  power back into the hands of citizens!

  ## How Aware Was Built

  Aware was built with a unique approach to addressing urban issues while
  maintaining user privacy. We crafted a solution that leverages multiple
  blockchain protocols, each serving a specific purpose in our ecosystem.

  ### Core Architecture & Implementation

  At the heart of Aware lies a two-chain architecture that separates private
  user data from public reports. We chose the Oasis Sapphire Network for our
  privacy layer, handling all sensitive user information through encrypted
  storage and secure verification processes. This network's privacy-first
  approach ensures that user identities remain protected while still allowing
  for verified reporting.

  For the main reporting platform, we implemented our solution on various L2
  chains and each one of those serves as a primary chain implementing a
  multi-chain system, which handles the public aspects of our system. This
  includes report management, our innovative point system, and community
  interactions. The separation allows us to maintain privacy where needed while
  keeping public data transparent and accessible.

  ### Technical Innovation

  What makes our implementation particularly interesting is our novel approach
  to user verification and report management. Instead of traditional KYC, we
  developed a privacy-preserving verification system on Sapphire that issues
  proofs without exposing user data. Users first verify themselves on Sapphire,
  where their sensitive information is encrypted and stored securely. Once
  verified, they can use the same wallet to submit reports on primary chain.

  Our point system is carefully crafted to encourage quality reporting while
  deterring spam and false reports.

  This creates a self-regulating ecosystem where users are incentivized to
  submit legitimate reports and actively participate in community validation.

  ### Partner Technologies Integration

  - **Oasis Sapphire:** We leveraged Sapphire's privacy
  features for our verification system. The network's ability to handle
  encrypted data while maintaining transparency where needed perfectly suited
  our requirements for user privacy.

  - **Filecoin:** For report media storage, we integrated Filecoin. This provides
  decentralized, permanent storage for report evidence while maintaining
  efficient access through IPFS. The content-addressing system ensures data
  integrity and immutability.

  - **Primary Chain (Multichain Ecosystem Consisting Various L2s):** These networks
  provide the scalability and cost-effectiveness needed for our main platform
  operations. Their high throughput and low transaction costs make it feasible
  for users to submit reports and interact with the platform regularly.
