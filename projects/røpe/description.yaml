  Trust-minimized on/offramp solution deployed as an MCP server. 

  No KYC, no middleman, no payment verification risk. Just verifiable execution
  with ROFL &amp; private data handling via OPL.

  Today, getting crypto with your fiat means trusting someone a centralized
  exchange, a counterparty, or a Telegram stranger. You send the money, and you
  hope it works. If it doesn’t? Good luck.

  **RØPE** changes that.

  We built a system where trust is no longer part of the equation. You send fiat
  from a Web2 app -like Wise or Modulr - and receive crypto in your wallet on
  your chosen chain, within seconds. No KYC. No middlemen. No "waiting for
  confirmation." Just a smooth, verifiable experience.

  When you send a fiat payment, the request is handled by an agent deployed as
  an MCP server. This agent acts like an automated operator: it verifies that
  the payment actually happened, keeps your private data secure, and once
  everything checks out, it sends the corresponding crypto directly to your
  wallet on-chain.

  With**&nbsp;zkTLS**, the system verifies your fiat payment cryptographically.
  **No screenshots**, no API polling, no trust.&nbsp;

  This proof feeds directly into the flow and ensures that the payment actually
  happened before anything moves.

  Meanwhile, your sensitive information -wallet addresses, access credentials-
  is protected on-chain using**&nbsp;Sapphire&nbsp;**and **Oasis Privacy
  Layer&nbsp;**(OPL).&nbsp;

  Once the payment is verified, the agent -running securely inside a TEE using
  ROFL- triggers the crypto side of the transaction. It interacts with services
  like Modulr (Wise alternative), Uniswap to perform the onramp, swap or bridge.
  And then the equivalent asset, say USDC, lands directly on your wallet on
  Base, or any supported chain and token.

  You don’t lose money. Nothing breaks. The system just waits.This isn’t an
  escrow. It’s not a swap platform. It’s a verifiable automation layer that
  connects fiat and crypto with trust-minimized assumptions.

  So&nbsp;**RØPE&nbsp;**is not just an on/offramp — it’s the shortest, safest,
  and most verifiable path between money you have and money you use.
