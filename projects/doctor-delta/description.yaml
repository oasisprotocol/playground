description: |
  Doctor Delta is an oracle & delta-neutral strategy for Euler enabling users to
  earn dual-yield.

  Doctor Delta allows users to set and forget USDC earning dual yield by hedging
  out the delta on GMX futures when funding rates allow for this to be
  profitable. Doctor Delta gets data from the Lab Assistant which is an oracle
  running in a TEE on ROFL comparing the supply and borrow APYs on Euler with
  funding rates on GMX to execute positions. When the rates reverse and holding
  this position becomes less profitable than just supplying USDC, Doctor Delta
  will unwind and revert to just supplying USDC until the next window of
  opportunity emerges.
