  GeoGuessr but decentralized and poker-ified, have fun competing against others
  by betting on how well you know the world.
  
  GeoGuessr is an exciting and educational game that challenges players to
  explore random locations on a map and guess where they are, blending geography
  knowledge with the thrill of discovery. It's a fun way to learn about the
  world while competing against others or testing your own skills.
  
  ZeoKuessr enhances this experience by introducing a competitive edge through
  crypto staking, where players can wager on their geographical knowledge. The
  integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and trusted execution environments
  (TEE) ensures a fair, tamper-proof environment, making the game even more
  engaging by adding transparency and trust to the competition. Itâ€™s a
  next-level evolution of GeoGuessr for those looking for both fun and fairness
  in their gameplay.
