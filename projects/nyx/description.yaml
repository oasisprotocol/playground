  A therapy AI app, prioritizing user privacy with off-chain chat storage.
  Therapists can securely access data on-chain, enhancing trust and transparency,
  all powered by ENS for easy identification.
  
  Introducing a cutting-edge therapy AI app developed using the Oasis Protocol,
  Dynamic Labs, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This app prioritizes user
  privacy by leveraging the confidential AI chat bot running on Oasis ROFL,
  ensuring that sensitive information remains secure. Therapists can request
  access to this data on-chain, facilitated by a seamless integration with the
  Oasis Protocol for enhanced security and scalability. With Dynamic Labs'
  innovative features and ENS for easy user identification, this app empowers
  both patients and therapists to engage in a trusted, transparent therapeutic
  experience.
