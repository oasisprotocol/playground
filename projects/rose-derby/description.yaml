  A horse betting "game", similar to real-world horse betting, except with
  simulated races using Sapphire RNG to determine the race results. What makes
  it interesting is that the participants are all completely private but the
  statistics and game activity is public, so it's obvious people are playing
  (and winning), but no one knows who is playing.
  
  Players are incentivized to schedule and find participants for races by
  setting a % organizer "take" which awards them a percentage of the total
  betting pool on a race. Then once the betting window has ended, players are
  then further incentivized to call the "determine race results" function to
  compute the results with Sapphire RNG and receive an additional percentage of
  the pool.
  
  I believe this project would be a great starter project for more serious web3
  on-chain gaming or even for casinos.
