  Shapeshifter DEX is a privacy-first decentralized exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies using multiple anonymous personas. 
  Users can create encrypted identities, switch between them seamlessly, and execute trades on Uniswap while maintaining complete anonymity. 
  The platform leverages Oasis Sapphire's confidential computation to ensure that persona data remains encrypted and private, even from the blockchain itself.

  Traditional DEXs expose user trading patterns and wallet addresses, creating privacy concerns and potential front-running vulnerabilities. 
  Users often want to:

  - Trade anonymously without revealing their main wallet identity
  - Separate different trading strategies across multiple personas
  - Prevent MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks by obfuscating trading patterns
  - Maintain privacy while still accessing DeFi liquidity

  Shapeshifter DEX solves these issues by allowing users to create multiple encrypted personas that can trade independently while keeping their real identity completely private.
