  NYAnCAT: The cutest and sharpest AI personal banking cat that brings you
  low-risk returns

  NYAnCAT is a World APP Mini App that can serve four roles: AI banking advisor,
  fund manager, AI news source, and governance tool.

  - As a personal banking AI advisor,  it can use ML to search for low-risk
    investment opportunities on CEXs.

  - As a fund manager, it can execute strategies and collect revenues.

  - As an AI news source, it can collect the latest market trends and present
    them to you in a few words.

  - As a governance tool, you can use it to vote for your favourite strategies.
