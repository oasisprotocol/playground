  A privacy-focused platform that makes managing payments simple and secure.
  With private static payment links that also work as ENS addresses, you can
  easily accept crypto or credit card payments while keeping everything
  untraceable.
  
  Squidl.me is a platform designed to give individuals and businesses total
  control over their payments and financial transactions. By using stealth
  addresses, Squidl ensures that every transaction is private and untraceable.
  With custom static payment links that double as ENS addresses, users can
  easily receive payments in crypto or fiat without exposing their identities or
  financial data. The platform offers seamless integration with various
  blockchain networks, including Ethereum, BSC, Morph, Linea, and Flow EVM,
  allowing users to accept a wide range of payment options. Additionally, credit
  card payments are converted to USDC and bridged to BSC, ensuring both
  convenience and privacy. Squidl also features the ability to bridge funds to
  the Oasis Sapphire network, where transactions become completely untraceable,
  adding an extra layer of security. Squidlâ€™s flexibility extends to asset
  transfers as well, supporting the private transfer of NFTs, soulbound tokens,
  and liquidity tokens. With its easy-to-use interface, unified dashboard, and
  powerful SDK for developers, Squidl is the go-to platform for anyone looking
  to manage payments with privacy, flexibility, and control.
