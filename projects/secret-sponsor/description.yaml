  Secret Sponsor offers a mechanism for anonymous gas-sponsoring, incorporating
  account abstraction and the Oasis Privacy Layer.

  Users can stay anonymous by:

  - Initiate encrypted funding transactions in Sapphire.
  - Bridge these funds to the Goerli account abstraction paymaster.
  - Execute transactions without incurring gas fees.
  
  Moreover, because the system focuses solely on gas-sponsoring, it becomes
  difficult to associate it with illicit actions such as money laundering. This
  is optimal privacy tailored for smaller users, particularly NFT artists.
