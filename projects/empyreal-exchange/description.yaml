  Abstracting wallets and encryption for users to allow for private transactions
  and encrypted data transfer.
  
  Fully privacy preserving implementation on Arbitrum that uses Sapphire as its
  privacy layer. In addition, we used the lessons learned in implementing this
  to put together a reference implementation for wallet abstraction on sapphire.
  The wallet abstraction builds on top of the tooling developed as we built the
  privacy preserving ERC-20 implementation.
