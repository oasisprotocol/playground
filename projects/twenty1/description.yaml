  A Telegram mini-app for Blackjack, with on chain game play and encrypted data.

  Twenty1 is a Telegram mini app where you can play the classic game of
  Blackjack with on-chain gameplay and encrypted data. Players can stake money
  and play against the dealer, earning double their stake when they win. The app
  ensures fair play through transparent blockchain technology, providing a
  secure and trustworthy gaming experience.

  We built the frontend using the React as well as Node.js framework and styled
  it with Tailwind CSS. The smart contracts were developed, tested, and deployed
  using Foundry and Solidity, ensuring a secure and reliable blockchain setup.

  Our project is deployed on both Flow and Oasis, and it supports the use of the
  Dynamic wallet for seamless user interactions.
