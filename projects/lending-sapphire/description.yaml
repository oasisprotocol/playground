  A private, KYC-free lending platform on Oasis Sapphire. Utilizes dual-token
  setup, ROFL (TEE) for fetching real time price feeds. Features on-chain and
  off-chain confidentiality to ensure secure, private transactions. 
  
  This platform takes full advantage of the Oasis Sapphire blockchain to offer a
  secure environment for executing EVM compatible smart contracts with enhanced
  on-chain data confidentiality. This feature ensures that sensitive transaction
  details such as sender and receiver information are encrypted, allowing users
  to engage in lending and borrowing without compromising privacy. This shields
  them from common blockchain threats like front-running, where exposed
  transaction details could be misused by opportunistic observers.
  
  Moreover, we integrate off-chain confidentiality using ROFL, which
  significantly boosts out platform's integrity and security, when paired with
  Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This setup not only secures sensitive
  operations like real-time pricing feeds but also ensures the accuracy and
  integrity of these feeds, crucial for calculating loan values reliably. By
  automating financial processes such as loan issuance based on collateral and
  auto-liquidation protocols in a secure manner, out platform delivers tailored
  and responsive financial services that preserve the inherent privacy first
  ideals of blockchain technology.
