  zk-oasis-sdk is a developer toolkit that compiles Circom circuits, generates zkSNARK proofs, and auto-deploys Solidity verifiers to Oasis Sapphire.
  It abstracts away complex workflows so developers can add privacy-preserving verification to their dApps with a single command.

  Building ZK applications is complex—requiring multiple tools, cryptography expertise, and manual deployments.
  On top of that, deploying to Sapphire means dealing with TEEs and confidential execution. zk-oasis-sdk unifies these processes into a seamless, automated pipeline.
