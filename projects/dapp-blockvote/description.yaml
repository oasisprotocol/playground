description: |
  A blockchain-based voting platform that leverages the confidentiality features
  of Oasis Sapphire ParaTime to facilitate secure and private elections. The
  platform allows organizers to create polls where participants can cast votes
  without revealing their choices to other users, while still ensuring the
  integrity and transparency of the overall voting process.
  
  Blockvote is designed as a private voting solution for DAOs and other groups
  that need to conduct opinion polls while maintaining voter privacy. Built as a
  fork of the Oasis Demo Voting App, it provides a simple but effective way to
  gather community sentiment on proposals while protecting individual voting
  data through Sapphire's confidential smart contracts.
