  Get paid for your voice! We are building the world's first voice monetization
  platform.

  Have you seen the "Hawk Tuah" meme? From just a few seconds of viral content,
  the woman in the clip turned her unexpected fame into a growing business, with
  podcasts, merch, and more. This is a perfect example of the rise of
  user-generated content (UGC) and how some are smart in monetizing their fame.

  Our project helps creators get paid for their voice. Specifically, we enable
  them to lend their voice to text-to-speech (TTS) models, and earn 90% of
  profits.
