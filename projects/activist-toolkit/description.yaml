  The Activist Toolkit is a privacy-preserving infra offering proof-of-protest,
  dead man's switch, and secure tools to protect activists, verify presence, and
  resist authoritarian erasure.

  🛡️ **Activist Toolkit**

  *Protect the protest. Preserve the proof.*

  A decentralized, privacy-first protocol to empower activists, protect their
  identities, and preserve immutable proof of protest — even under repressive
  regimes. Built using Oasis Sapphire and ROFL, Activist Toolkit provides
  censorship-resistant infrastructure to verify presence, coordinate emergency
  alerts, and resist digital erasure without exposing user identities.

  ✊ **Why Activist Toolkit?**

  Activist Toolkit&nbsp;is a secure, censorship-resistant system for modern
  human rights defenders.

  In the face of growing **authoritarianism and digital surveillance,**
  activists around the world are risking their lives — but often have&nbsp;no
  way to verify their actions, protect their communications, or prove their
  contributions.

  Conventional digital tools like photos or chat logs are:

  **Blockchain&nbsp;**isn't just useful — it's**&nbsp;essential.**It's
  the&nbsp;only infrastructure&nbsp;that makes proof tamper-proof,
  decentralized, and permanent.

  **🔍 What It Does**

  ✅ Proof of ProtestAnonymous, geolocation-based, timestamped credentials that
  verify protest participation — without revealing personal identity.

  🔴 Dead Man Switch (Red Alert)A failsafe timer that triggers alerts to trusted
  contacts if an activist goes silent or is detained.

  🧾 Peer Attestation SystemA decentralized verification process where trusted
  members vouch for presence, preventing fake participation or infiltration.

  **🔑 Feature Examples**

  ✅**&nbsp;Proof of Protest**

  *Anonymous, verifiable presence — without needing to reveal your face or
  contacts.*

  Sidika&nbsp;is applying for asylum in the Netherlands. As a gender rights
  activist from Turkey, she must prove her involvement in protests — but she
  never appeared in photos and won't share private chats.Using Activist Toolkit,
  she receives an&nbsp;immutable, peer-attested credential: she was present at X
  protest, on Y date, verified by trusted witnesses.

  Now she has verifiable proof —&nbsp;without compromising herself or others.

  **🔴 Dead Man Switch**

  *Secure fallback for detained activists or those crossing danger zones.*

  Abdul&nbsp;is helping his sister cross a border into Germany. He sets
  a&nbsp;6-hour timer&nbsp;in the toolkit.If he doesn't cancel in time, the app
  automatically sends a&nbsp;prewritten message&nbsp;to his Telegram group of
  legal and support contacts.

  This feature can trigger help when silence becomes danger.

  **🔧 Tech Overview**

  ✅ We use *roflEnsureAuthorizedOrigin&nbsp;*to guarantee only verified, secure
  TEE-originated data is accepted on-chain.🔧 Note: Link to code implementation
  will be added soon.

  **🚧 Roadmap: Work in Progress**

  We truly believe in the long-term existence of this project. We would aspire
  to continue improving the current features as well as adding more like:

  🪙 Anonymous FundraisingCreate and contribute to activist campaigns privately
  via blockchain-native donations.

  💬 Activist Education ChatbotA conversational AI assistant trained on global
  activist handbooks for real-time, context-aware guidance.

  🌐 Global Network ExpansionDevelop tools for collective resource sharing and
  decentralized reputation systems across movements.
