  Last will and testament for crypto holders. Keep your will private while
  you're alive. After you're deceased, beneficiaries can claim their share.

  **Testament**

  This project implements a decentralized crypto inheritance system using a
  Testament contract on Oasis Sapphire and a Vault contract on another network.
  The Testament keeps the will (heirs and allocations) hidden until the owner
  dies and the executor unlocks the assets from the Vault for distribution.

  **"Your legacy, safe and private—until it matters most."**

  You’ve built something meaningful. A family, a community, or a financial
  legacy in the world of crypto. You want to pass it on with care. In the
  traditional world, you would visit a notary, who holds your last will
  securely, only to be revealed after your passing. No one could tamper with it.
  No one could pressure you to change it. No one even knew what was inside.

  **Until now, that was impossible in Web3.**

  With *Testament*, we’ve brought that trusted notary model to the blockchain.
  Using Oasis **Sapphire’s confidential smart contract execution**, your will
  remains completely hidden—even from the network itself—until the time comes.
  No nosy observers. No frontrunners. No risk of heirs or outsiders pressuring
  you to reveal or amend your testament while you’re alive.

  When you’re gone and no longer able to signal your presence, your testament
  becomes available to your beneficiaries exactly as you intended. Immutable.
  Transparent. Fair.

  *It’s dignity, privacy, and finality—reimagined for the decentralized world.*
