  Last will and testament for crypto holders. Keep your will private while
  you're alive. After you're deceased, beneficiaries can claim their share.

  This project implements a decentralized crypto inheritance system using a
  Testament contract on Oasis Sapphire and a Vault contract on another network.
  The Testament keeps the will (heirs and allocations) hidden until the owner
  dies and the executor unlocks the assets from the Vault for distribution.
