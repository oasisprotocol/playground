  Linda is a private and human-first location-based social app that connects
  friends.

  Linda combines proof-of-humanity authentication with private real-time
  location streaming. Every account requires Self Protocol's passport-based ZK
  verification—eliminating bots and fake profiles. Location data processes
  inside Oasis ROFL TEEs, so even the app operators can't access coordinates.

  The architecture uses a React Native frontend, Self Protocol for identity on
  Celo, and Oasis ROFL containers running in Intel TDX enclaves for location
  processing. TEE encrypts and stores data in Sapphire confidential contracts,
  notifying users when friends are nearby without exposing raw locations.
