  An on-chain privacy-preserving auction platform that allows auctioneers to
  launch secret auctions to sell their tokens/NFT.
  
  Currently, the platform offers 2 types of on-chain auctions:

  - Blind auction: (sealed bid auction) is a type of auction where all bidders
    commit their offers in sealed envelopes, without knowing the bids of the
    other participants. The highest bid wins the auction.
  - Lottery auction: is a type of auction where the winning bid is determined
    randomly.
