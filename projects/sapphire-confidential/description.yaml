  Make yours transactions private on web3 blockchains with the power of
  Sapphire.
  
  Secure Hardware like TEE, HSM, Secure Enclave, gives the possibility to handle
  private key that are directly accessible by nobody (depending of the physical
  security of the hardware) and that can be used for detaining assets and
  signing transactions for the blockchain.

  Using virtual addresses is smoother for mixers and remove the constraint to
  have fix amount of asset locked and to have a long minimum time for waiting.

  Oasis Sapphire blockchain give the possibility to manage private keys within a
  private smart contract where the data are kept private into the contract with
  secure enclave technology. and private exchange.
