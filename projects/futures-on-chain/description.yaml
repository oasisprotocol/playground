  This project delivers an on-chain futures trading solution on Oasis Sapphire,
  using ROFL for secure trading. Users can trade ERC-20 futures linked to
  currencies like ETH, with real-time pricing and machine learning for accurate,
  transparent trading.

  Key Features:
  - On-Chain Futures Trading
  - Simulated Price Fluctuations with Tamper-Proof Oracle Integration
  - AI-Powered Trading Bot with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model for
    Market Predictions
  - Automated Profit and Loss Management
  - Privacy-Preserving Execution with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
  - Trade History and Performance Tracking

  ## How We Did It?

  - **Contract Development**: The main contract, located at
  `rofl-oracle/oracle/Oracle.sol`, integrates core trading functionalities with
  Oasis Sapphire's ROFL setup. By using `Subcall` from the
  `@oasisprotocol/sapphire-contracts`, we ensured a seamless interaction between
  the trading logic and the ROFL environment for accurate data processing and
  pricing.


  - **Backend Iterations**:  The many iterations of the backend creation and
  the logic behind it can easily be seen located at the
  rofl-oracle/oracle/src/tasks.ts where all the main logic and trades can be
  done via the CLI without launching the React app for a easier testing
  environment.

  ## How to Add Your Own Trading Bot

  If you'd like to add a custom trading bot, follow these steps:

  - **Replace the LSTM Model**: In the current setup, `rofl-oracle/Lstm
  model/training.py` trains a basic LSTM model and generates a `model.tflite`
  file. To use a different model, modify `training.py` with your preferred
  algorithm, train the model, and save it as `model.tflite`.


  - **Adapt the ROFL App**: Depending on the structure of your new model, you
  may need to adjust `rofl-oracle/src/main.rs` to account for different inputs
  and outputs. This might include altering the input format for the latest OHLCV
  (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) signals based on your data source, such as
  CryptoCompare or any other API of your choice.


  - **Deploy and Test**: Once configured, deploy the updated ROFL app within
  the Oasis Sapphire environment to test the bot's performance in predicting
  market trends and generating signals.

  ## Why ROFL?

  ROFL is essential to the platform’s success due to its tamper-resistant price
  data capabilities:

  - **Data Integrity**: Ensures price data authenticity, guarding against
  manipulation and fraud in decentralized environments.

  - **AI Integration**: Supports the LSTM-based trading bot, providing reliable
  price trend predictions based on secure data feeds, essential for a
  trustworthy trading experience.

  ## Why Oasis Sapphire?

  Oasis Sapphire offers privacy and scalability ideal for a futures trading
  platform:

  - **Privacy**: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on Sapphire keep
  sensitive trading data confidential.

  - **Scalability**: Low latency and high transaction handling support efficient
  trading, even under heavy load.

  - **Reliability**: Sapphire’s security ensures that the platform remains
  robust, making it an ideal choice for this privacy-focused, on-chain trading
  solution.
