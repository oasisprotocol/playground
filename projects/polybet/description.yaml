  AI powered, privacy enforcing, prediction market smart router

  PolyBets represents a sophisticated evolution in the prediction market
  ecosystem, functioning as a decentralized aggregator that unifies multiple
  betting platforms into a single, privacy-preserving interface. At its core,
  the platform addresses a fundamental inefficiency in the current prediction
  market landscape: the fragmentation of liquidity and pricing across numerous
  isolated platforms.
