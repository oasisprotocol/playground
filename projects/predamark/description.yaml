  PredaMark is a confidential prediction market that allows users to place bets on real-world events, such as elections, 
  sports, or crypto price movements, while keeping their predictions private until resolution. 
  Bets are encrypted on-chain using Oasis Sapphire, ensuring no one can see which side a user chose. 
  Once the outcome is verified via Oasis ROFL, the system automatically decrypts and pays out winners in a trust-minimized way.

  Traditional prediction markets suffer from two major issues:

  - Lack of privacy – Every bet is public, which can discourage participation or lead to herd behavior.

  - Trust in oracles – Outcomes depend on centralized feeds that may be biased or manipulated.

  PredaMark solves these problems by:

  - Encrypting predictions on-chain so no one can view them until the event is resolved.

  - Using ROFL secure enclaves to fetch and verify real-world outcomes in a trusted, verifiable manner.
