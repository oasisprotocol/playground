  Trusted Rust compiler that uploads encrypted projects to Walrus storage 

  Is a secure Rust compiler system that enables privacy-preserving code
  execution through decentralized storage. The system works by uploading
  encrypted Rust projects (packaged as tar.gz files) to Walrus decentralized
  storage, where they receive a unique blob ID. Users can then retrieve these
  encrypted projects using the blob ID and execute them in an isolated
  environment, maintaining source code confidentiality throughout the entire
  process. The system integrates with ROFL (TEEs) on the Oasis Sapphire testnet
  for confidential computing capabilities, allowing developers to compile and
  run Rust code without exposing their intellectual property. While currently
  supporting only Rust, the goal is to expand support to multiple programming
  languages in the future.

  We first use TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) as secure enclaves provided
  by Oasis, and therefore we put a Rust compiler inside them for having
  attestation and to be sure that this is being executed in a secure
  environment. For providing the Rust projects, we used Walrus for encrypting
  them, achieving that only the TEE will know the code and it can't be extracted
  from it
