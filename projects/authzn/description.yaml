  This project demonstrates how to use WebAuthN on Oasis Sapphire.
  This allows users to use strong device-level authentication, such as TouchID,
  YubiKey, Android biometric, Windows Hello etc.<br/>
  
  Currently it only supports SEC P256 R1 credentials, and additional work will
  be needed to adapt it to your specific use-case.<br/>
  
  Also includes the code for TOTP authentication.<br/>
  
  Usage:<br/><ol>
  <li>Register at the Oasis Authenticator by using one of the strong device-level
  authentication methods.</li>
  <li>Your ID will be stored on the Sapphire chain.</li>
  <li>Log in to one of the services which support the Oasis Authenticator (for
  example the <a href="https://playground.oasis.io/authzn-demo/">Authzn Demo app
  </a>)</li>
  <li>The app will receive a valid token from the smart contract, if the logging
  in via the Oasis Authenticator is successful.</li>
  </ol>
