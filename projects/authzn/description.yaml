  This project demonstrates how to use WebAuthN on Oasis Sapphire.
  This allows users to use strong device-level authentication, such as TouchID,
  YubiKey, Android biometric, Windows Hello etc.
  
  Currently it only supports SEC P256 R1 credentials, and additional work will
  be needed to adapt it to your specific use-case.
  
  Also includes the code for TOTP authentication.
  
  Usage:

    1. Register at the Oasis Authenticator by using one of the strong
       device-level authentication methods.
    2. Your ID will be stored on the Sapphire chain.
    3. Log in to one of the services which support the Oasis Authenticator (for
       example the [Authzn Demo app](https://playground.oasis.io/authzn-demo/).
    4. The app will receive a valid token from the smart contract, if the
       logging in via the Oasis Authenticator is successful.
