  A Decentralized Subscription-Based Content Hosting Platform.
  
  Our platform
  operates seamlessly with live data feeds, making it ideal for real-time
  content delivery. It caters to content creators by providing an anonymous
  channel to receive feedback, enriching the engagement without compromising
  privacy.
  
  ## Problem & Solution

  The blockchain world faces a critical shortage of reliable oracles which
  connect real-world data to blockchain systems. Our solution is a
  community-driven ecosystem that simplifies the process of creating an oracle.
  We aim to reduce entry barriers and make operating an oracle not only feasible
  but also lucrative.
  
  ## Key Features

  - **Anonymous Transactions**: Both content creators and subscribers engage in
    financial transactions and feedback sharing without revealing their
    identities.
  - **Incentivized Oracle Ecosystem**: Encourages the community to contribute to
    the accuracy and reliability of data feeds.
  - **Broad Compatibility**: Our platform supports devices as simple as Arduino
    or Raspberry Pi, integrating them into the blockchain to deliver valuable
    real-time data.
