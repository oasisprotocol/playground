description: |
  A confidential voting dApp that enables ROSE holders to participate in
  community decisions on the Oasis Network. The first implementation allowed
  the community to vote for the Oasis Network's official mascot, choosing
  between a Capybara (symbolizing Interoperability), a Desert Owl (symbolizing
  Knowledge), and a Fennec Fox (symbolizing Privacy).
  
  Built using Oasis Sapphire ParaTime, the dApp ensures vote privacy while
  maintaining transparency in the voting process. The platform is designed to
  be extensible for future community governance decisions beyond the initial
  mascot vote.
