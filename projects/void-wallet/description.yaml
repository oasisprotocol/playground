  Privacy-first wallet for confidential, compliant, and cryptographically secure
  transactions.

  Void Wallet is a privacy-preserving wallet built on a hybrid architecture that
  combines Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and
  Sparse Merkle Trees. It delivers confidential transactions at a fraction of
  the cost of pure ZK solutions while giving users complete control over their
  compliance.

  Key features:

  - Confidential computation via Oasis ROFL TEEs for off-chain transaction
    processing
  - User-controlled compliance with ZK proofs that don't reveal transaction
    history
  - Cryptographic safety net with Sparse Merkle Trees for emergency withdrawals
