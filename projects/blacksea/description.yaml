  Cross chain Dark Pool Orderbook
  
  An orderbook matching engine that keeps all pending and executed orders
  private. Founders, Whales and Institutional Investors can finally trade tokens
  onchain without being surveilled.
  
  By leveraging the privacy preserving properties of Oasis the contract is able
  to receive, keep and process encrypted limit orders from different traders,
  never sharing the information with anyone. Whenever 2 limit orders match, the
  contract executes them without anyone but the parties involved learning about
  the trade.
