  Trustless fair-play gambling using TEE and Oasis Sapphire â€” no cheating, just
  the game

  TR.I.G.O. (Trustless Implementation of Gambling Online) is a blockchain-based
  framework that ensures fairness and transparency in online gambling. It
  addresses the critical issue of trust in digital casinos, where players
  currently have no guarantee that games are not rigged or manipulated by the
  house.

  By leveraging Oasis Sapphire, a privacy-focused blockchain platform that
  integrates Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and ROFL, an EVM-compatible
  chain supporting verifiable randomness and confidential smart contracts,
  TR.I.G.O. eliminates the possibility of tampering, peeking, or cheating by
  centralized operators.
