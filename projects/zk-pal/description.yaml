  On-ramps/Off-ramps system using Paypal

  Access to cryptocurrencies is becoming increasingly restrictive. Users must
  now go through centralized exchanges, complete KYC procedures, and wait for
  validation. ZK-Pal aims to restore trustless peer-to-peer exchange using
  PayPal as a fiat bridge.

  Our objective is to offer an alternative aligned with the foundational
  principles of blockchain: decentralization and peer-to-peer exchange. By
  leveraging an existing payment system like PayPal, we aimed to enable users to
  buy and sell crypto without relying on centralized intermediaries. Through
  this project, we introduce an on-ramp/off-ramp mechanism where users can
  create and fulfill USDC offers in exchange for PayPal transfers.

  The process begins when a user creates an offer on a smart contract deployed
  on Oasis Sapphire. This contract allows the user to lock a specified amount of
  USDC and securely store sensitive information, such as their PayPal handle,
  using Sapphire’s confidential features. Another user, interested in purchasing
  the USDC, can subscribe to this offer through the contract. After subscribing,
  the buyer must send the agreed amount via PayPal to the seller and retrieve
  the confirmation email from PayPal for this transaction.

  The buyer forwards the PayPal confirmation email to a dedicated email address,
  accessible only by ROFL container. This container operates within a trusted
  execution environment (TEE) using Oasis's ROFL system. Its role is to
  automatically fetch incoming emails, verify their authenticity, extract the
  relevant details—such as the PayPal handle and transferred amount—and, upon
  successful validation, interact with the Sapphire smart contract to release
  the locked USDC to the buyer.
