  On-ramps/Off-ramps system using Paypal

  Access to cryptocurrencies is becoming increasingly restrictive. Users must
  now go through centralized exchanges, complete KYC procedures, and wait for
  validation. ZK-Pal aims to restore trustless peer-to-peer exchange using
  PayPal as a fiat bridge.

  Our objective is to offer an alternative aligned with the foundational
  principles of blockchain: decentralization and peer-to-peer exchange. By
  leveraging an existing payment system like PayPal, we aimed to enable users to
  buy and sell crypto without relying on centralized intermediaries. Through
  this project, we introduce an on-ramp/off-ramp mechanism where users can
  create and fulfill USDC offers in exchange for PayPal transfers.
