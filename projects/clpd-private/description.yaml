  A future where stablecoin transactions is private thanks to the Oasis Network.

  We'd like to advance crypto adoption in LatAm by introducing privacy-focused
  transactions to our Chilean peso stablecoin (CLPD). With Oasis Network’s
  confidential EVM, Sapphire, we’re integrating private transaction capabilities
  that will give users more control over their financial data.

  Leveraging the Oasis platform’s Privacy Layer, our CLPD project offers a new
  layer of security for users, allowing:

  - Confidential national and international transfers.
  - Safe transactions that protect financial data.
  - Access to both digital and real-world assets with full data privacy.

  With support from the Oasis community and technical resources, we’re building
  toward a future where individuals across LatAm can securely use blockchain
  technology in everyday transactions without compromising privacy.

  ### Focus: Private Access to Financial Transactions

  We aim to tackle the challenge of providing private transaction options for
  LatAm users who need secure, discreet financial solutions. In a region where
  privacy is a growing concern, our platform offers a way to make digital
  transactions confidently and securely.

  ### Education and Trust in Privacy Technology

  Beyond access, educating users about the benefits of private blockchain
  transactions is essential. Many people in LatAm are wary of blockchain due to
  the transparency of most public ledgers. Using Sapphire’s confidential EVM,
  we’re helping users understand how they can benefit from privacy-enhancing
  features while maintaining transparency through verified proof of reserves.

  ### Interoperability

  Our submission introduces CLPD’s private transaction feature, integrated with
  Oasis Sapphire and bridged via Chainlink CCIP, allowing for secure, private
  transfers on the Oasis Network. With CLPD’s design, users can make private
  transactions seamlessly, knowing their financial data remains confidential.

  In CLPD, we use ROFL (Runtime Oracle For Ledgers) to securely access banking
  data through code execution in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). This
  allows us to obtain and verify the current balance of reserves in real-time,
  thus ensuring the constant maintenance of 1:1 parity between CLPD and CLP.
