  A revolutionary platform implementing Universal Basic AI (UBAI) - ensuring
  every human has access to AI compute power as a fundamental right. Built on
  Oasis Protocol for complete privacy and anonymity

  Universal Basic AI in a future where AI becomes essential for education, work,
  and daily life, we risk creating a world where only the wealthy have access to
  advanced AI capabilities. **Universal Basic AI** prevents this dystopia by
  guaranteeing every person a fair allocation of AI compute power based on their
  country of origin.
