  Sentibot is an AI-powered bot that tracks, analyzes, and summarizes sentiment
  across crypto communities, social feeds, and developer channels to help teams
  react quickly with data‑driven insights.

  It aggregates high-signal conversations and market chatter into succinct
  updates, highlighting trend shifts and anomalies so projects can respond in
  minutes, not hours.

  What it does:

  - Real‑time sentiment tracking across multiple sources
  - Summaries and alerts for spikes, anomalies, and notable topics
  - Lightweight dashboards for teams and community managers

  Why Oasis:

  - Puts user and community privacy first while still enabling useful insights
  - Can leverage confidential compute for sensitive data handling
