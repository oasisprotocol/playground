  Proprietary Automated Market Maker launchpad built on top of Uniswap V4 using
  TEEs.

  P.A.T builds on Uniswap v4 hooks to create a prop AMM launchpad on Ethereum.
  Prop AMMs are popular with market makers on Solana but haven't existed on
  Ethereum due to EVM limitations. We combine Oasis TEEs with oracle-driven
  pricing to enable complex off-chain price computation with on-chain settlement
  guarantees.

  Orders are grouped into batches inside a TEE using Oasis Runtime's offchain
  logic, where proprietary strategies run safely. Market makers can use our
  default oracle-driven strategy (powered by Pyth price feeds) or plug in custom
  strategy contracts.
