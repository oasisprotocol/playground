  GuardianChain is a privacy-preserving whistleblowing platform built on Oasis
  Sapphire, designed to align with Malaysia's Whistleblower Protection Act 2010
  (Act 711). It lets reporters submit anonymous, encrypted disclosures and
  evidence, while giving investigators a tamper-proof audit trail and secure
  communication.

  Optional identity verification and role-based workflows help organizations
  handle cases without exposing sensitive data. The system keeps reports
  confidential yet verifiable, reducing retaliation risk and improving trust in
  investigations.
