  This Minesweeper project takes the classic logic game and builds it on the Oasis Sapphire blockchain network,
  introducing transparency and fairness through secure, verifiable randomness. 
  Players navigate a 5x5 grid with randomly placed mines, betting with TEST tokens to avoid mines, and winning based on safe moves.
  The problem it solves

  It addresses fairness concerns in online gaming by ensuring that mine placements are random, private, and resistant to tampering. 
  Using Oasis Sapphire’s RNG (Random Number Generator), players can trust that the game outcome is unbiased and secure.
