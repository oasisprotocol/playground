  Your private vault on the blockchain, ensuring your secrets remain exclusively
  yours, with no leaks and complete control!
  
  Can you imagine the chaos if all your passwords & private keys & seed phrases
  or any recovery code(i.e. 2FA Secret) disappeared tomorrow? ðŸ¤¯
  
  Today, we manage countless account details, passwords, and private keys, often
  needing to create new ones every day. Typically, we rely on centralized
  platforms like traditional password managers.ðŸ˜•
  
  But what if these systems were to suddenly shut down? How would we secure our
  data?ðŸ¤”
  
  That's where OasisGuard steps in. This browser extension safeguards your
  passwords within a confidential smart contract, accessible only through your unique Passkey(Webauthn). By leveraging Sapphire's Confidential EVM, we've placed all passwords into a 'black box' thatâ€™s accessed using commonly used Passkeys, verified through r1 curve signatures on Oasis.
  
  Do I need to pay gas fees for each account detail I add?
  
  No, you don't need to pay gas fees for that. We've integrated Paymaster. We
  handle this using the EIP155Signer.sign() method to broadcast the transactions
  you send, through our Gasless Proxy contract. This ensures that you wonâ€™t have
  to pay any gas fees.
  
  But there's moreâ€”OASISGUARD also allows for the secure sharing of passwords
  with others via Semaphore, enabling group creation and seamless collaboration,
  whether it's with one person or an entire team.
  
  Moreover, it's worth noting that we have implemented this entirely with an
  Externally Owned Account (EOA). With the upcoming **EIP-3074**, EOAs will be
  able to perform some operations currently only possible with Smart Accounts,
  making the integration of a passkey with an EOA even more valuable.
