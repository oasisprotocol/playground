  Privatized health data monetization. Help real people solve real problems
  without risking exposure.

  HealthTrust turns sensitive health records into a self‑sovereign,
  privacy‑preserving data asset that patients can safely monetize. Using
  Oasis Sapphire’s confidential‑EVM and ROFL enclaves to keep raw files
  invisible and IPFS for immutable storage. We let researchers run verifiable
  computations on encrypted data while patients retain absolute control. The
  result is a legal compliance ready market for health insights that can power
  AI and help advance research, all without breaches or data hoarding.

  **Vision**

  We envision a world where every bit of health data, from your daily steps and
  workouts to overnight sleep patterns, is encrypted at the source and flows
  into a secure, decentralized marketplace. Users connect their wearables once,
  retain full control over who accesses their data, and earn tokens whenever it
  fuels valuable research.
