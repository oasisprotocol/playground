  Privatized health data monetization. Help real people solve real problems
  without risking exposure.

  **Overview**

  HealthTrust turns sensitive health records into a self‑sovereign,
  privacy‑preserving data asset that patients can safely monetize. Using
  Oasis Sapphire’s confidential‑EVM and ROFL enclaves to keep raw files
  invisible and IPFS for immutable storage. We let researchers run verifiable
  computations on encrypted data while patients retain absolute control. The
  result is a legal compliance ready market for health insights that can power
  AI and help advance research, all without breaches or data hoarding.

  **Vision**

  We envision a world where every bit of health data, from your daily steps and
  workouts to overnight sleep patterns, is encrypted at the source and flows
  into a secure, decentralized marketplace. Users connect their wearables once,
  retain full control over who accesses their data, and earn tokens whenever it
  fuels valuable research.

  More than an MVP, HealthTrust lays the foundation for a thriving ecosystem in
  which personal health signals drive scientific breakthroughs and personalized
  care, while keeping privacy and fairness front and center.

  ****WorkFlow of Health Trust**

  Users begin by pairing their wearable accessory (e.g., a fitness tracker or
  smartwatch) with our platform. From that moment on, all raw sensor data,heart
  rate, activity metrics, sleep patterns, etc. is encrypted in the user’s
  browser using the ROFL enclave’s public key, ensuring that only code running
  inside the Trusted Execution Environment can ever decrypt it.

  Storage on IPFS:

  The encrypted data blob is pushed to IPFS, and its resulting Content
  Identifier (CID) is recorded on-chain for future retrieval.

  To aid discovery, we expose only a small set of non-sensitive metadata
  (gender, special conditions(diabetes, Asthma), BMI, etc.) in plaintext, so
  researchers can browse and filter available datasets without seeing any
  personal health details.

  Data Offer &amp; Request:

  Users create a “data offer” by registering the IPFS CID and metadata in a
  smart contract, along with staking terms.

  When a researcher identifies a dataset of interest, they submit their analysis
  code (e.g., an aggregate calculation) and stake tokens to the same contract.
  This emits an on-chain event signaling the ROFL enclave to begin processing.

  Confidential Computation in ROFL:

  An off-chain relayer feeds the event to the ROFL module. Inside the enclave,
  the sequence is:

  Fetch encrypted blobs from IPFS.

  Decrypt using the participant’s symmetric key.

  Run the researcher’s submitted code.

  Encrypt the result with the researcher’s public key.

  Result Delivery &amp; Settlement:

  The enclave uploads the encrypted result back to IPFS and submits the new CID
  on-chain.

  Once the smart contract verifies the result hash, it automatically releases
  the staked tokens to the data contributors.

  The researcher retrieves the final ciphertext from IPFS and decrypts it
  locally, confident that at no point was any personal data exposed outside the
  TEEs.

  This workflow guarantees end-to-end confidentiality, transparent marketplace
  discovery, and aligned economic incentives, letting users effortlessly
  monetize their wearable data while preserving absolute control over its
  privacy.

  **Development Remarks**

  Single ROFL Key PairTo avoid managing many user keys and on-chain lookups, all
  data is encrypted with one ROFL public key; only the enclave holds the secret
  key.

  Event-Driven ExecutionRather than researchers calling ROFL directly, the
  enclave now listens for smart-contract JobRequested events to trigger
  confidential computations.
