  A Fusion+ powered cross-chain swap between any EVM-supported chain and XRP
  Ledger

  SwappaTEE enables trustless token swaps between XRPL and Ethereum chains
  without intermediaries. It is powered by 1Inch's Fusion+ protocol and a TEE
  implementation of the escrow contracts on the XRPL side.

  Instead of using centralized exchanges or risky bridge protocols, users get
  direct wallet-to-wallet swaps between XRPL and Ethereum. The TEE ensures
  escrow contracts execute correctly without requiring trust in any
  intermediary.
