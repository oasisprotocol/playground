  A Private Decentralized & Distributed Search Engine built on Sapphire:
  
  - **Privacy-Centric Search**: DSearch employs advanced encryption and
    privacy-preserving techniques to ensure user anonymity. When a user submits
    a search query, it is processed in a way that separates the user's identity
    from the query itself. This means that neither DSearch nor any external
    entity can trace the query back to the user. Additionally, DSearch doesn't
    store user search history or use tracking cookies, guaranteeing that user
    data remains private.

  - **Decentralized Infrastructure**: DSearch operates on a decentralized
    network of nodes, each hosting a copy of the search engine's index. This
    decentralized architecture enhances fault tolerance and resiliency. When a
    user submits a query, it is routed through this network, ensuring that there
    is no single point of failure or control.

  - **Anonymous Browsing**: DSearch not only prevents tracking by search engines
    but also protects users from website tracking mechanisms. By using the Oasis
    Privacy Layer, it acts as a privacy shield between the user and the websites
    they visit, blocking cookies, scripts, and trackers commonly employed by
    websites. This comprehensive approach ensures that user activity remains
    truly private during their online journeys.

  For building DSearch, we constructed a very complicated infrastructure in the
  backend. We later realised that this infrastructure can be open-sourced and
  will be beneficial to a lot of people building on OPL. We called this protocol
  as API Link and DSearch serves as just one compelling use case within its
  ecosystem. API Link is a protocol that allows Oasis Sapphire users to securely
  invoke APIs to interact with the external world. By connecting on-chain events
  and data with the external world, we believe that this protocol will bridge the
  gap between the two worlds and open up a new domain of decentralized
  applications (dApps). Here's what API Link does:

  - Secure API Invocation
  - Bridging On-Chain and Off-Chain Data
  - Enhanced dApp Possibilities
  - Augmenting the Oasis Network
