  Private Animal Health Records on Oasis that rewards good owners with Circles

  The Farea project is a decentralized application designed to manage Animal
  Health Records privately using Sapphire Testnet and distribute rewards using
  ROFL and Circles.&nbsp;

  You can create Animals and add health records which are stored privately in
  the AnimalHealth.sol contract deployed on Sapphire Testnet.
