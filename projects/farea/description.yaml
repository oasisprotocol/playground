  Private Animal Health Records on Oasis that rewards good owners with Circles

  The Farea project is a decentralized application designed to manage Animal
  Health Records privately using Sapphire Testnet and distribute rewards using
  ROFL and Circles.&nbsp;

  You can create Animals and add health records which are stored privately in
  the AnimalHealth.sol contract deployed on Sapphire Testnet.

  You can fetch the data signing with your wallet and trigger the decription of
  the data to be visualized.

  Then you can assign rewards to a wallet that will get picked by the script
  running in ROFL that will trigger a token transfer of Circles from the
  organization to the designated wallet.

  Here are the contract addresses, app id and a github issue that I encountered
  while coding the project.

  The github provides detailed instructions to deploy the project.
