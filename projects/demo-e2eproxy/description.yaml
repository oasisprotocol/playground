  A short example of how a contract can relay an end-to-end encrypted
  transactions on Oasis Sapphire, so the relayer cannot see which contract is
  being invoked or what the parameters are. This is usefull for services such
  as the gas station network or other gasless services.

  By using the [@oasis-protocol/sapphire-contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oasisprotocol/sapphire-contracts)
  library the E2EProxy contract generates a long-term X25519 keypair which
  allows users to submit a Deoxys-II encrypted payload (with forward secrecy)
  containing the contract address to invoke and the calldata to pass.
