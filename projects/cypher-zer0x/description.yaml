  Cypher Zer0x addresses a fundamental issue in the blockchain ecosystem: the
  lack of a privacy-focused, compliant layer for transactions. By integrating
  natively ring Confidential transaction (RingCT) within its universal Layer 2
  infrastructure, and due to it's design that combine plasma contract and
  zk-rollup, it offers a robust solution for users and organizations requiring
  both privacy and compliance in their blockchain interactions. Here are some
  problems solved by this solution:

  - **Lack of Compliant Privacy**: Traditional blockchain platforms often force
    users to choose between privacy and compliance. Cypher Zer0x eliminates this
    compromise, ensuring transactions remain private and fully compliant with
    regulatory standards.
  - **Complex Cross-Chain Transactions**: Interacting with multiple blockchains
    typically involves complex processes that can compromise privacy and
    security. Cypher Zer0x simplifies cross-chain transactions, making them more
    accessible and secure.
  - **Privacy Misconceptions**: Privacy is to often associated with malicious
    activities. Cypher Zer0x challenges this by providing a platform where
    privacy is a right, not a suspicion, while staying fully compliant.
