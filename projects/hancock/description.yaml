  Anonymous dating app where connections start with shared
  interests, not photos or names. Match, chat, and reveal identities only when
  ready. Powered by Oasis blockchain for top-notch privacy, Hancock offers
  secure, meaningful, and exciting connections.

  Hancock is an innovative and privacy-first dating platform that redefines how
  people connect online. Its primary focus is ensuring users feel secure,
  anonymous, and in control of their interactions, breaking away from the
  traditional norms of online dating.

  ## Key Features and Workflow

  ### Anonymous Profiles

  Unlike conventional dating apps, Hancock does not reveal user identities
  immediately. When users sign up, they create a profile that remains anonymous.
  This profile highlights interests, preferences, and other general attributes,
  but it does not include identifiable details like names or photos. This
  anonymity ensures that users are judged based on their personality and
  interests rather than appearances.

  ### Swiping Mechanism

  Users browse through profiles and swipe based on the details provided. The
  swiping interface resembles popular dating apps, offering a sense of
  familiarity while emphasizing privacy.

  ### Mutual Matches

  If two users swipe right on each other, they form a match. At this stage, they
  can begin chatting anonymously within the app. This layer of interaction
  allows them to build a rapport and understand each other without pressure.

  ### Identity Reveal

  Hereâ€™s where Hancock stands out: identities remain hidden even after a match.
  Users can continue chatting anonymously for as long as they want. If both
  parties feel comfortable and mutually agree, they can reveal their real
  identities. This step ensures that users progress at their own pace, fostering
  trust and meaningful connections.
