  Turn video insights into action. Earn NFTs, join group challenges & win crypto
  from Monthly  Pool

  The Purpose is a self-growth game powered by AI and Web3. Users pick any
  inspiring YouTube video, and our AI transforms it into a 7-level
  transformation journey-  from reflection and real-life action to group
  collaboration and public sharing.

  At Level 5, users pay a fee to enter a team challenge. If their group
  completes all 7 levels, each validated user earns a NFT that grants access to
  a monthly staking Reward pool.

  The TEE repository is available [here](https://github.com/ThePurpose-ETH-Global-Cannes/the-purpose-tee).
