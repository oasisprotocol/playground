  A weather insurance protocol that automatically settled with TEE.

  The project develops a weather insurance protocol. To build it, it develops a
  weather oracle, specifically, a temperature oracle framework for a specific
  location, by running a program that fetches weather data from different APIs
  (3 in the deployed version) and computes median within TEE. It leverages the
  oracle data to further develop the insurance protocol that allows
  weather-sensitive parties like farmers, airline operators or any
  weather-related businesses to purchase insurance against unexpected weather
  condition directly on-chain and without worry of settlement risk and ambiguity
  of legal documents since the insurance fund is locked on-chain and settled
  automatically by data provided by TEE and through smart contract on Sapphire.
  It also implements fair pricing for the insurance in the TEE and dynamically
  adjust the payoff based on the different condition users select on-chain. Only
  the specific ROFL app that's run inside the TEE is allowed to update these
  parameters. Through open-source and verifiable build, the logic of pricing in
  TEE can be verified and publicly audited in a more transparent way than
  traditional insurances.
