  On-chain credit scores and slashing for AI agents audited in Oasis ROFL TEEs.

  AgentCred is an accountability layer for AI agents. Each agent has an NFT
  identity (ERC-8004 aligned), staked tokens, and a public reputation score.
  When an agent produces sensitive output, it's verified inside an Oasis ROFL
  TEE against hard rules and real data.

  Smart contracts on Oasis Sapphire record results, update reputation, and
  automatically slash 0-15% of the agent's stake based on the score. The goal
  is to let DAOs and protocols approve or reject AI agents based on verifiable
  behavior—good agents build track records, bad agents lose money on-chain.
