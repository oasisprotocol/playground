  Catch monsters in a Pokémon-style game powered by on-chain randomness,
  privacy, and ROFL.

  **Implementation details**

  MonCraft is a retro-inspired, top-down RPG where players explore a grid-based
  world, encounter wild Monsters, and attempt to catch them — blending on-chain
  privacy with real-time gameplay.

  The game leverages **Oasis Sapphire** and **ROFL** to introduce on-chain
  privacy and secure randomness into the gameplay, ensuring fairness and
  decentralization.
