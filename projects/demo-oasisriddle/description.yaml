  This dApp demonstrates the power of the Sapphire confidential storage and
  tries to empower new developers to start building. The dApp stores a set of
  questions and expected answers on Sapphire. It also stores a set of coupon
  codes together with the private key unlocking the rewardâ€”ROSE or other tokens
  on a production chain.
  
  Usage:

  Coupon codes are handed over to potential developers on different occasions
  such as the blockchain conferences, hackathons, programming competitions etc.
  The developer needs to set up local Sapphire development environment, query
  for the question passing their coupon code and finally submit the answer.
  Then, they can reclaim the rewarding private key.
