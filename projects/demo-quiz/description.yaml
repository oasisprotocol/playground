  A simple confidential multiple choice quiz dApp. The questions and answer key
  are stored on-chain. Once a user solves the quiz, they can (optionally) claim
  a ROSE reward. The payout transaction is gasless, so they **do not require
  MetaMask, pay gas fees or use any 3rd party oracles** to receive the reward.
  
  The dApp was originally developed to educate fresh developers about the Oasis
  platform. By sending them a small amount of ROSE, they can immediately start
  hacking and deploy their dApps on the Mainnet.
  
  To try out the demo, use `testCoupon1` through `testCoupon50` coupon codes.
