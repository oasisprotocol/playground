  SaphireX is a private, KYC-free lending protocol built on the Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM runtime. 
  It leverages ROFL (Runtime Oracles for Layered Finance) to fetch real-time price feeds securely inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
  With SaphireX, users can lend and borrow assets without exposing sensitive financial information publicly. 
  Borrowing terms, collateral ratios, and loan health remain confidential on-chain, ensuring both transparency of execution and privacy of data.

  Key features:
    - Confidential Lending & Borrowing – Keep loan data private on-chain.
    - TEE-powered Oracles (ROFL) – Reliable real-time price feeds within enclaves.
    - Dual-token architecture – Lending assets + governance/stability token for protocol operations.
    - KYC-free access – Permissionless, private lending without identity exposure.
