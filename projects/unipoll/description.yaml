  What it does
    - GroupSwap enables social group trades on Uniswap v4.
    - Users pool ERC20 deposits, vote (weighted by deposit), and execute a collective swap when quorum and end time conditions are met.
    - A Uniswap v4 hook enforces that only GroupSwap-approved swaps can execute.
    - Optional Oasis Sapphire integration adds private voting with signature verification via Sapphire precompiles.

  The problem it solves

    - Coordinating group trades is hard: scattered approvals, unclear thresholds, and trust issues.
    - GroupSwap provides a transparent, on-chain governance flow for a one-shot trade:
      - Clear proposal window and quorum.
      - Weighted voting by capital committed.
      - Enforcement via a hook that prevents unauthorized swaps.
    - With Sapphire, sensitive vote choices can be kept private while still verifiable on-chain.
