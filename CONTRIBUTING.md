# Contributing to the Oasis Playground

Developers are encouraged to add their dApp to the Oasis Playground. In order
to list your dApp, follow the steps:

1. Make sure your dApp is licensed under the one of the [OSI-approved]
   licenses.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Copy `projects/.template` to a new directory inside `projects/` and name it
   after your dApp. Inside your new directory, find `description.yaml` and adapt
   it accordingly to best describe your dApp.
4. Add screenshots of your dApp into `projects/your-dapp/screenshots/`.
   The screenshots of your dApp will be sorted by their file name. The first
   screenshot will be shown on the landing page and the rest in the dApp details
   page.
5. Create a Pull Request and wait for a member of the Oasis engineering team to
   review it.
6. Once the Pull Request is approved and merged, your dApp will be listed at
   https://playground.oasis.io.
