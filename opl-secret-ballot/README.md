## Secret Ballot Lite
This is a demo or light weight version of [opl-secret-ballot](https://github.com/oasislabs/opl-secret-ballot).

There are two key smart contracts that we will deploy, one interacting with a host chain
such as Binance and one interacting with OPL or an enclave on Sapphire.

### Backend

This repo is set up for `pnpm` but other NodeJS package managers should work.

Install dependencies
```sh
pnpm install
```

Build smart contracts
```sh
pnpm run build
```

### Frontend

Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Build assets for deployment
```sh
pnpm run build
```

### Local Development

We will use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview)
and [Hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) to simplify development.

Start local Hardhat network
```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy smart contracts locally
```sh
npx hardhat deploy-local --network localhost
```

We can now reference the deployed contracts in our frontend Vue app.

Modify the `.env.development` file with the appropriate addresses:
```yaml
VITE_BALLOT_BOX_V1_ADDR=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```
and
```yaml
VITE_DAO_V1_ADDR=0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
```

Additionally, we will need a [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud) API [key](https://docs.pinata.cloud/pinata-api/authentication)
to access the pinning service with which we store our ballots as JSON.

```yaml
VITE_PINATA_JWT=
```

Start Vue app
```sh
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5173, and you should be able to create a new poll.

You can use one of the pre-funded test accounts and associated private key with MetaMask,
use 'Add a network manually' with these parameters to connect to your local Hardhat node:

 * Network name: `Hardhat`
 * New RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`
 * Chain ID: `1337` (or leave blank to auto-detect)
 * Currency symbol: `TEST` (or leave blank)

### Docker + Makefile

If you prefer to run everything safely inside inside a Docker container,
a Makefile is provided for your convenience:

```
make docker-shell                # Bash shell inside container
node@opl:~$ make build
node@opl:~$ make backend-node &  # Run local Hardhat node
node@opl:~$ make backend-deploy  # Deploy contracts to local node
node@opl:~$ make frontend-dev &  # Run VITE development server
```
